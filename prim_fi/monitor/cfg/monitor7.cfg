# Configuration parameters;
#	In this section every data consits of two parameters, where
#		v=fix value (valid if 's' is not defined or initially while the
#			signal is not set by a module)
#		s=signal name (the value of the signal overrides 'v' if the signal
#			is written; when the module starts the signals' values are set
#			to the value given with 'v')
#

# Module's priority (0-29)										[10, -]

PRIO: v=18  s=MON7_PRIO

# Print messages to logfile (0/1)								[0, -]
#			v=0 means don't print anything (except upon initialisation)
#			v=1 means print error messages

LOGF: v=1   s=MON7_LOGF

# Maximum number of lines in logfile (min 1)					[10000, -]
#			The logfile will be reopened after the given number of lines
#			had been written. (Backup will be created.)

FLEN: v=10000 s=MON7_FLEN

# Print messages to console (0/1)								[0, -]
#			v=0 means don't print anything (except upon initialisation)
#			v=1 means print error messages

LOGC: v=1   s=MON7_LOGC

# Console name													[-, -]
#			If not defined, the program's current console is assumed

#CNAM:  v=/dev/con1 s=MON7_CNAM

# Print messages to message window (0/1)						[1, -]
#			v=0 means don't print anything
#			v=1 means print error messages

LOGM: v=1   s=MON7_LOGM

# Period to poll the server for changed signals (sec; min 0)	[0, -]
#			If 0, the server will notify the module to poll for data instead
#			of cyclical polling.
#			This value can only be modified upon running if it is initially
#			set to nonzero ie. only the poll interval can be changed not the
#			communication method.

#POLL:  v=0   s=MON7_POLL

# Max number of open views (min 2)								[5, -]

VMAX: v=5    s=MON7_VMAX

# Main (uncloseable) view's ID; 0 = undefined (min 0)			[0, -]
#			(If undefined, the first defined view will be loaded upon
#			startup.)

MAIN: v=1   s=MON7_MAIN

# Number of individually refreshed objects per view (min 0)		[0, -]
#			If more than this number of objects should be redrawn, the rest
#			of the picture will be actualised at once (as a single object);
#			this speeds up a picture's refreshment but may involve the
#			redrawing of a larger area the picture contains many overlapping
#			objects

REFR: v=50    s=MON7_REFR

# Timeout to clear the Edit Buffer; 0 = disbale; (sec; min 0)	[30, -]

FACL: v=0   s=MON7_FACL

# Operating mode (0/1/2/3)										[0, -]
#			v = 0 means MENU,
#			v = 1 means EDIT (inspect/modify object's parameters),
#			v = 2 means ACKN (reset object's status flags),
#			v = 3 means HELP (show object's help info) mode;
#				If 's' is undefined 'v' means the STARTING operating mode;
#			otherwise 's' will be set to the current mode set by the user
#			AND the current mode will be set accordingly to the signal's value;
#			If the mode is 'MENU', clicking with the mouse's right button
#			on a view's dynamic object opens a menu where the operator can
#			choose among the other modes; otherwise immediately invokes the
#			function according to the current mode (EDIT/ACKN/HELP).
#				These functions can be disabled by the 'OMWP', 'OPWP', 'OACP'
#			and 'OHPW' flags.

MODE: v=1   s=MON7_MODE

# Lowest necessary user prior to enable Object Menu (0-255)		[254, -]

# Maximum number of rows to open param window to (min 1)		[10, -]

PROW: v=10  s=MON7_PROW

# Maximum number of rows to open edit window to (min 1)			[10, -]

EROW: v=10  s=MON7_EROW

# Override configuration data from the server's database (0/1)	[0, -]
#			If set to 1, the default initial values of all the configuration
#			signals listed in this file will be overriden with the values read
#			from the server upon startup.
#			Note: this value cannot be modified upon running; the signal can
#			only be used to display the given setting;

# Picture files:
#		This section defines the picture files to use.
#		The parameters here override the appropriate records' 'PATH' fields
#		in the initialisation file.
#		To store these values in signals is currently unsupported.
#		A file's description general format is the following:
#
#		Pi: f=file p=prior s=strcons n=name c=command
#		Vi: f=file p=prior s=strcons1 o=strcons2 n=name c=command, where
#
#			- 'P' means parameter views and 'V' means normal views;
#			- 'i' is a unique ID; it need not be continuous or successive.
#				If an Id is multiply defined, the LAST occurence will be used.
#				Picture objects and (the 'VLD', 'VCL' functions) use this
#				number to identify which picture to open/close. On the other
#				hand the view opening menu ('VOPW') function displays the
#				pictures according to the definition order. Until a picture's
#				ID is unchanged it can be moved to a different position without
#				the side-effect to referring to a different picture file;
#			- 'p' defines the lowest necessary user prioity to load the picture;
#				(0-255; If an other priority user logs in, the higher priority
#				pictures are closed.) The default is 255.
#				Note: this field is unused for the main view ('MAIN');
#			- 's' defines a signal which will be incremented when the picture
#				is opened and decremented when it is closed; for normal views
#				this can be 0/1 and for parameter views the number of the
#				currently loaded instances;
#			- 'o' defines a signal via which the view can be opened (if the
#				signal is written to nonzero) and closed (if the signal is
#				written to zero);
#			- 'n' can be any string to describe the picture; if given this will
#				be shown in the picture's title bar instead of the file's name;
#				(Mustn't contain blank characters except ASCII 255.)
#			- 'c' is an optional command name; this comand will be invoked
#				every time the window becomes active;
